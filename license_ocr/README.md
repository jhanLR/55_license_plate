Official PyTorch implementation of our four-stage STR framework, that most existing STR models fit into. <br>
Using this framework allows for the module-wise contributions to performance in terms of accuracy, speed, and memory demand, under one consistent set of training and evaluation datasets. <br>
Such analyses clean up the hindrance on the current comparisons to understand the performance gain of the existing modules. <br><br>
